# C-Games

C Games is a C program for basic games.

This is my first project and it was made when I was in college.
Back in the day, My partner and I made it as we were participating in a college level coding competition called C Project Showcase.

I made a blog about back then too. Check out here: https://projectgcos.blogspot.com/2017/05/about-project-gcos.html

Thanks for reading ;). Peace.
